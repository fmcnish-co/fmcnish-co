Hi! My name is Fredy M. and this is my Github site. In this, I will publishing some open projects that I'll be developing as well some info and ideas to share. Be free to contact me if you need something. I'm also open to colaborate and learn about other projects.

My preferences are: DataScience, Artificial Intelligence, Arduino or NodeMCU, Python, Java. 

# Projects

The projects published here are: 
- **AirQA:** is a Javascript frontend for an Air Quality community project I was colaborating. The main idea was to show the visualization of the data. In this, I use **leaflet** for maps and **D3** for visualization.
- **Roarse:** is an Arduino project about a line follower robot. The code works pretty well but in need some improvements. This was developed for a Science Fair.
- **ML:** here are my **Jupyter Notebook** for a meetup I hosted. I was showing the translation between a classification model from KNime to Python (the sample excercise was the Titanic dataset for *Survival prediction*.
